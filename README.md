The goal of this project is to design and prototype a robotic system that can automate the cleaning of vertical window surfaces.

## Project Components
- Arduino-based motor control
- Sensor integration for edge detection
- Basic frame design for movement on glass

## Course
Intro to Engineering â€“ NYU Tandon School of Engineering
